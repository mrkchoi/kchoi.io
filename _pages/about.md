While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe - minimalist and not _too_ modern.

Thanks for reading!
