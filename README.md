Syntax highlighting langs
Did you add a YAML value with a colon or dash in it? E.g., title: Cool Title: Common Syntax Error - Yes Wrap it in quotes: "Cool Title: Common Syntax Error - Yes".
Did you change _config.yml? Check the indentation and quotes.
Is the change you made not showing up? Clear your cache and check .gitignore.
Is a link broken? Does it have too many or too few forward slashes somewhere?
